    """
     Computes the mean free path for "primary" electrons
     with energy phi_p incident on mercury plasma with electron
     density ne, neutral density ng.
     Applicable to mercury only! Based on the computer
     model of Peters and Wilbur for excited and ionized species
     populations in Hg.

     Inputs:
     - ne: Electron density (1/m3)
     - ng: Gas density (1/m3)
     - phi_p: Plasma potential (V)
