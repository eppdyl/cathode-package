## Literature review of measurements

### Goebel et al (JAP 2005)
Contains data about the NEXIS ("1.5-cm cathode"):
- ne vs position for mdot = 5.5 and 10 sccm and do = 2 mm and 2.8 mm
The data is used p.267 in Goebel and Katz' 2008 book for Fig. 6-14

### Goebel et al (JPP 2007)
Contains:
- VD vs Id for the 0.8, 1.5, and 2.0 cm LaB6 cathodes with 0.38 mm orifice, 0.64 cm keeper distance, at 9 sccm
- ne vs position for the 0.38 cm insert
- phip vs position for 0.38 cm insert at 13 A, 3.7 sccm AND 0.7 cm insert at 25 A, 7 sccm

### Goebel and Watkins (Rev. Sci. 2010)
Tests the LaB6 hollow cathode with an inner diameter of 0.38 cm and an orifice diameter of 0.38 cm.
This is essentially a tube cathode.
Goebel and Watkins obtain ne vs. position for a single operating point (3.7 sccm, 13 A)

### Goebel et al (IEPC 2011)
More information on the LaB6 cathodes. Goebel et al test both th 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm cathodes
They obtain for the 1.5 cm cathode:
- VD vs ID for 8, 10, 12 sccm
- VK vs ID for 8, 10, 12 sccm
- ne vs position for various currents at 8, 10, 12 sccm 
- phip vs position for 100 A, at 8, 10, 12 sccm 
- Te vs position for 100 A, at 8, 10, 12 sccm 

For the 2 cm cathode:
- VD vs ID for 8, 10, 12 sccm
- VK vs ID for 8, 10, 12 sccm
- Torifice vs ID

### Chu and Goebel (IEEE 2012)
This is mostly a repeat of the 2011 paper, but it features error bars.
It has a full test for the 1.5 cm cathode.
The same data is shown as in the IEPC 2011, along with:
- phip and Te vs position at 50 A
- Te vs ID at 8, 10, 12 sccm
- ne vs position for 20 to 100 A by increments of 10 A
