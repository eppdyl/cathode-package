### Description
This folder contains the data pertaining to the NSTAR neutralizer and discharge hollow cathodes. The following articles were mined for data:

- K. K. Jameson, D. M. Goebel, and R. M. Watkins, “Hollow Cathode and Keeper-Region Plasma Measurements,” 41st AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, 2005.

- I. Katz, I. Mikellides, D. Goebel, and J. Polk, “Plasma Heating of Inert Gas Hollow Cathode Inserts,” 30th Int. Electr. Propuls. Conf., no. June, pp. 1–9, 2007. Note that this paper is actually referencing 2004 results for their Fig. 2 and says it's from the NSTAR, but these are for the NEXIS, not the NSTAR! Also, the paper referenced does not run with or without orifices... The NSTAR also never was run with a 2 mm orifice, AFAIK.

### NSTAR Neutralizer 

### NSTAR Discharge
Reference usage:
- Polk 2004: Tc vs. position for (mdot,Id) = (9,6),(8,8),(7,10),(5.5,12), Tc vs. position for Id = 12 A and mdot = 5.5,6,7,8,9,10 sccm; peak Tc and peak Torifice vs. mdot and Id 
- Mikellides 2005
- Mikellides 2006
- Jameson 2005: (for TH8 and TH15) ne, phip, Te,  vs. position, ion energy distributions (radial and axial), radial profile of plasma potential
- Mikellides 2008 (for TH8 and TH15) ne, phip vs. position for close to orifice and in the keeper region; it includes error bars!

Here is the list of data that can be digitized
- ne vs. position at TH8 and TH15
- phip vs. position at TH8 and TH15
- Te vs. position at TH8 and TH15

The TH8 and TH15 operating points are considered to be
|     | TH8 | TH15 |
|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| Id (A) | 8.24 | 13.3 |
| Vd (V) | 26.3 | 25.6 |
| mdot (sccm) | 2.47 | 3.7 |
| Tc,max (K) | 1383 | 1473 |
