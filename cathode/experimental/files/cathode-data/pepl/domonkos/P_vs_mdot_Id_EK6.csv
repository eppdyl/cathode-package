### DOCUMENT
# [1] M. T. Domonkos, "Evaluation of low-current orificed hollow cathodes," University of Michigan, 1999.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Cathode Internal Pressure Under Various Operating Conditions
# Fig 3.29: Orifice plate temperature dependence on keeper type in a diode discharge
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (sccm of Xe), P (x10^(-3) Pa), propellant mass (amu), do (mm), Lo (mm), Tw (degC)
### Notes
# Extracted from the overall plot; this data is for the EK6. Need to multiply pressure by 1e3 to obtain the correct values
# IGNORE THE FOLLOWING (kept for posterity) "The mass flow rate values are not exactly the same from one run to the other one, so I kept them as raw data values extracted from the plots."
# The temperature data is the orifice plate temperature
