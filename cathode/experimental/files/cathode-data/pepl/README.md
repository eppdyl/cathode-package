### Domonkos' work
Domonkos presents a bunch of cathodes in a series of papers and in his dissertation. The cathodes are designated with either "AR" ("Aspect Ratio"), "EK" ("Enclosed Keeper"), or OK ("Open Keeper").
The dimensions are shown below

Notes:
- SC012: The thickness of the cathode tube is 0.25 mm
- The OK6 and EK6 are denoted as EK1 and OK1 in Table 2.1 p.18 of Domonkos' dissertation.
- AR6' is pretty much the AR6; was originally used with a R500 coated tantalum insert, but insert was changed to BaO-W
