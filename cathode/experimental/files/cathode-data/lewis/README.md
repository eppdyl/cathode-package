This folder contains work from NASA Lewis. 

### Salhi's work
Though Salhi graduated from Ohio State University, his testing was done at Lewis.

#### Cathode
Salhi does not name his cathode. Dimensions are given pp52-53 in his dissertation.

Notes:
- Tube is 5.59 mm-ID, and 63.5 mm-long
- Orifice has a 45 deg. chamfer, and has a 5.84 mm OD

Materials
- Orifice: 2% thoriated tungsten
- Insert: BaO-W
- Tube: Mo-Re


### Siegfried's work
Siegfried graduated from Colorado State University; his grant, however, was on advanced electric thruster research through NASA Lewis.
A series of contractor reports from his PI P.J. Wilbur can be found online.

#### Cathode
Siegfried's cathode operates on mercury, argon, or xenon. The noble gas cathode seems to appear only in a 1984 contractor report. 
Ref. [3] suggests a 1.9 mm diameter cylindrical porous tungsten insert, impregnated with Semicon Type 84-S
The pressure data from Ref.[6] is for a 3.9 mm diameter cylindrical insert. The insert is tantalum foil coated with R-500, p.11 
Ref. [4] has no data on dimensions.
Different cathode tests have been used. The insert length may be 2.2 mm for the "current accounting tests", but other tests include longer inserts.
In Ref. [8], the segment insert has a total length of 15 mm.

### Friedly's work
Friedly graduated from Colorado State University; his grant, however, was on advanced electric thruster research through NASA Lewis. His work is after Siegfried's

#### Cathode
The cathode operates only on xenon. Measurements in [1] show that the pressure measurements are accurate to +- 1 Torr
