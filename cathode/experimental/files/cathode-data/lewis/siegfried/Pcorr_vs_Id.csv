### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Internal Pressure - Flow Rate Correlation 
# Internal pressure/Flow rate correlation for argon
# Internal pressure/Flow rate correlation for xenon 
### DATA
# Id (A), P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA),  [P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA)]_upper, [P/(mdot/do^2) (Torr - mm^2 / mA)]_lower, species (n/a)
### Notes
# Mercury: The boundaries for the mass flow rates are 90 mA and 450 mA
# Argon: The correlation varies with flows from 50 mA to 1300 mA and orifice diameters of 0.34 mm to 1.0 mm. The lower and upper bounds are given as corr_up and corr_low 
# Xenon: The correlation varies with flows from 50 mA to 1300 mA and orifice diameters of 0.25 mm to 1.0 mm. The lower and upper bounds are given as corr_up and corr_low
