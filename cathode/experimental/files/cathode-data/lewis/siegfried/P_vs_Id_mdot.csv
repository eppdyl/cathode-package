# ### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (mA), P (Torr), Propellant mass (amu), do (mm), Tw (degC), Lo (mm)
### Notes
# Mercury cathode with a 0.76mm diameter orifice
# Table p. 14 of Ref. [1], p.4 of Ref. [2]. 
# Temperature data for the cases at 3.3 A are from Ref. [2] 
# Orifice length is from Ref. [3], p.130
# The insert temperature for the experiments at fixed Id = 3.31 A but varying mass flow rate are taken to be the same as the one reported for 3.31 A
