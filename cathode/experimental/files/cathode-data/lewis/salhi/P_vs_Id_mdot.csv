### DOCUMENT
# [1] A. Salhi, "Theoretical and experimental studies of orificed, hollow cathode operation," The Ohio State University, 1993.
### SOFTWARE
# Plot digitized using Engauge Digitizer
### CAPTION
# Various
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (A), do (mm), propellant mass (amu), P (Torr), Lo (mm), Tw (deg C)
### NOTES
# Ar, mdot = 0.93 A, T vs Id for 0.76 mm: Fig 5.70 
# Ar, mdot = 0.93 A, T vs Id for 1.27 mm: Fig 5.70. We consider 1.27 mm approximately equalt to 1.21 mm to keep same orifice sizes
# Ar, mdot = 0.5 A, T vs Id for 1.21 mm: Fig 5.68. Measurements are taken 6 mm away from the orifice
# Xe, mdot = 0.93 A, T vs Id for 1.21 mm: Fig 6.3
# Xe, mdot = 0.5 A, T vs Id for 1.21 mm: Fig 5.68
