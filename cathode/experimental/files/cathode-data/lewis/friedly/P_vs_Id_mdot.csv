### DOCUMENT
# [1] V. J. Friedly, "Hollow cathode operation at high discharge currents", M. Sc. Thesis, NASA CR-185238, 1990 
### DATA
# Id (A), mdot (mA), P (Torr), propellant mass (amu), do (mm), Lo (mm), Tw (degC)
### CAPTION
# Fig 30 p.65: Effects of discharge current and cathode configuration on cathode wall temperature
# Fig 33a p.69: Effects of discharge current and propellant flowrate on cathode internal pressure
### NOTES
# Xenon cathode
# 6.4 mm outer tube, 0.74 mm orifice diameter => 4.7 mm insert diameter
# Lo is not specified so we set it as 1 mm
# The cathode wall temperature is plotted with a single point for a flow rate range of 180 to 550 mA; we consider that the wall temperature stays constant with flow rate.
