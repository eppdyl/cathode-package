### Cathode data
This repository contains digitized data of hollow cathodes, and other useful data.

The list of cathodes will grow in time. Orifice hollow cathodes currently considered:
- JPL

    - NSTAR
    - NEXIS
    - LaB6 cathodes

- Lewis

    - Siegfried and Wilbur Hg, Ar, and Xe cathodes 
    - Salhi's Ar and Xe cathode
    - Friedly's Ar and Xe cathode

- PEPL

    - Domonkos's Ar and Xe cathode

- RAE

    - T6 cathode 

- SITAEL

    - HC1
    - HC3
    - HC20
    - HC60

The original material (i.e. plots, digitizer, csv or tsv files) is in the folder original-material. Each subfolder has a title, and a README for the paper of origin. The name of the folder is author-publication-year.
Multiple papers are merged to get the overall data for a single cathode.
